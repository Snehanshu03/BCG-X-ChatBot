# BCG-X-ChatBot
Financial Chatbot Prototype

## How it Works:

This chatbot uses simple if-else logic to respond to 5 predefined financial queries based on data manually extracted from 10-K reports of Microsoft, Apple, and Tesla (2021–2023).

## Supported Queries:

1. What is the total revenue of Microsoft in 2023?
2. How has Apple’s net income changed from 2022 to 2023?
3. What are Tesla’s total assets in 2023?
4. What is the cash flow from operating activities for Microsoft in 2023?
5. How did Apple’s total liabilities change from 2021 to 2023?

## Limitations:

* Only responds to exact predefined queries.
* No natural language understanding or real-time data integration.
* Doesn’t scale beyond hardcoded responses.

Tested via terminal using input() prompts.
